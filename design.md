# Shelley design

## Introduction

Shelley is a simple experiment to see if the author could make a Unix-like
shell.

Even through it is experimental a good design with a good set of requirements
is still needed to make a foundation that could be built on. This document
aims to be that set of requirement and design to make a good and stable
foundation.

# Requirements

It has not yet been decided if the shell should be POSIX compatible, or use
its own style and syntax (like [C Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell)
or [Fish](https://fishshell.com)).
